How automapping rules work

Make for every layer you want an automap_$name.tmx file and add them as new line to the rules.txt file.
Define the regions layer, the input_$name layer and the output_$name layer and the output_objects layer in the .tmx file.
Add your regions and input output and objects like you need it.
